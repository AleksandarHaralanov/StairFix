# StairFix
## What's StairFix?
**StairFix** is a Minecraft plugin designed for servers running version b1.7.3. It fixes breaking stairs not returning the stairs block.

> [!CAUTION]
> If your server runs Residence, Towny, or JVillage, it won't handle it well and might result in people being able to break stairs within protected areas.
>
> WorldGuard however works fine since the plugin implements a check for that.
